<h1>Problem: BoringCorp Bonuses</h1>

<p>Some <b>BoringCorp</b> employees are complaining about not getting all of their meagre annual bonuses. There's also a rumour in the office that others are getting extra. At least they're not complaining, but Boss McBoss needs it fixed.</p>

<p>The original coder of bonus functionality, Bob, is adamant that tests were done and ran as expected. However Bob's been fired by Boss McBoss, and you've been ordered to try add tests to <b>expose any bugs</b>. You <i>don't</i> even have to fix those bugs- you get a bonus bonus for each bug you uncover in the bonus calculator. Is it actually possible that some employees get too much and others too little?</p>

<p>Here's the simple original rules for <b>BoringCorp</b> bonuses:</p>

<h2>FAQ Q112 How much is my annual bonus?</h2>

<p>If you are a salary employee, you'll get a week's worth of that salary (yearly salary/52) as your basic bonus</p>

<p>If you are an hourly-rate employee, you get a bonus of your hourly-rate*(half of your base contract hours-per-week).</p>

<p>You are also entitled to an additional percentage based on your <b>years of service</b>, calculated using your <b>original start date</b></p>
<ul>
<li>0-1 years: 0% extra</li>
<li>1-2 years: 20% extra</li>
<li>2-5 years: 50% extra</li>
<li>5-10 years: 100% extra</li>
<li>10+ years 150% extra</li>
</ul>

<p>As an extra madcappery, if this year is a leap year, you will get an extra special <b>'Leap Bonus'</b> of 8 hours <i>(hourly rate employees)</i>, or 1 day's worth of your salary (week amount/5 for <i>Salary peeps</i>)</p>

<p>All bonuses will be rounded <b>UP</b> to the nearest Euro value</p>
